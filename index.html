            <li>The player with the highest card takes the cards from that round.</li>
            <li>If there is a tie between the highest value cards, then we have WAR!</li>
            <li>When there is WAR, each player puts a card into the pot, and then shows their next card. The player with the highest card showing wins the cards.</li>
            <li>Select the 'Number of Players' and press 'Start New Game' to begin.</li>
            <li>Good Luck!</li>
